		My name is Raju Bajracharya.  I am looking to start carrier in technical support too. Let me tell you about myself. I am studying Information Technology System Support in Sheridan Brampton, I am in my final semester. I am a hard working responsible person who is reliable and I have a good academic background with good grades. I have 8 months of co-op experience too during my course. During my course I have learned computer technology, customer service, team work as well as individual assignment to meet the dead lines. In short, I am a complete package of academic background, Co-Op experience and mature mind skillful person. It would be great if I get a chance to work in this company as my first job after school.

		By the way do you mind if I asked you to have your card. So, I could send you my resume to tell you more about me in detail. Thank you so much
